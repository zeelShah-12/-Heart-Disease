# Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data and a trained machine learning model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using `pandas` and `numpy`
- Model training with `scikit-learn`
- Visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Pre-trained model saved as `.pkl` for easy loading

## Files in this Repository
- `Heart_Disease_py.ipynb` → Main Jupyter notebook
- `heart_disease_model.pkl` → Saved trained ML model
- `scaler.pkl` → Scaler used for preprocessing data
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies for running this project
